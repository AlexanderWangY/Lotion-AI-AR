## 🚀 Project Overview

**Lotion** provides slippery smooth notes supercharged by AI and AR. Our immersive platform combines Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence to make assisted learning available to all.

We came up with this idea when one of our teammates was studying for statistics before the beginning of the Hackathon. He realized that he was spending ages and ages navigating through the uncountable amounts of hopelessly long notes he had taken for his first exam. 

Thus, we had the idea to create an AI powered note taking platform that classified, stored, and retrieved notes whenever you needed. Not only does it take away all the headache of searching through your notes by providing a note querying system based on your questions, it has an immersive AR based system that scans your homework to return the most relevant notes!

## 🌟 Features

- ✨ **Note Classification**: Automatically classifies and stores your handwritten or typed notes
                              based on content and the classes you are taking
- 🚀 **AR Note Annotations**: Displays relevant notes based on scanned information in your camera
- 🔧 **Note Querying**: Returns relevant notes based on text input questions or statements
- 📈 **Interactive Interface**: Ease of access to all taken notes
